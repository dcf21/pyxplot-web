This plot illustrates some of the crossing points of the function
exp(<i>x</i>)sin(<i>1/x</i>).  Both x1 and x2 axes are logrithmic, but the x1
axis has ticks placed on it at fixed multiplicative intervals to 2, whereas the
x2 axis has labels placed manually at positions chosen to illustrate the
crossing points of the function.  The y1 axis is automatically ticked (and is
linear) whereas the y2 axis has no ticks at all.
