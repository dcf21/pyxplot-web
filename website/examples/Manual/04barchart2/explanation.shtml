This example demonstrates different ways of specifying the widths of bars on a
bar chart. In panel (a), the widths are automatically determined from the data,
changing bar midway between datapoints, using the <tt>boxes</tt> plot style.
In panel (b), the <tt>boxes</tt> plot style is used again but with a specified
<tt>boxwidth</tt>, which gives equal width boxes.  Panel (c) illustrates the
<tt>wboxes</tt> plot style, which reads the widths of the bars from a third
column in the datafile. And in panel (d) we illustrate how the
<tt>fillcolour</tt> modifier can be used to produce coloured bars.
