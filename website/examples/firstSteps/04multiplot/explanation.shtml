In this example, the multiplot environment is used to produce a gallery of
several plots. The <tt>set origin</tt> command is used to position each one. We
also make use of multiple <i>y</i>-axes in the top-left plot: the functions
sin(<i>x</i>) and sin<sup>2</sup>(<i>x</i>) are plotted together, but on different
<i>y</i> scales.
