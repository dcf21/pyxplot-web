This example demonstrates different ways of specifying the widths of bars
on a bar chart. In panel (a), the widths are automatically determined from the
data, changing bar midway between datapoints. In panel (b), the <tt>wboxes</tt>
plot style is used, which reads the widths of the bars from a third column in
the datafile. In panel (c), we demonstrate how the <tt>set boxfrom</tt> command
can be applied to bar charts, as well as to impulses. And in panel (d) we
illustrate how the <tt>fillcolour</tt> modifier can be used to produce coloured
bars.
