Here, we show two possible applications of the <tt>arrows</tt> plot style.
 In the left panel, we plot a map of fluid flow around a vortex core, the
dotted circle showing the outline of the vortex core. The source for this is a
datafile mapping fluid velocity as a function of position. In the right panel,
we show a series of datapoints before and after some correction factor is
applied to them, showing how the data are moved in the process.
