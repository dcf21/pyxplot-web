<P>
PyXPlot is a commandline graphing package, which, for ease of use, has an
interface based heavily upon that of gnuplot - perhaps UNIX's most widely-used
plotting package. Despite the shared interface, however, PyXPlot is intended to
significantly improve upon the quality of gnuplot's output, producing
publication-quality figures. The commandline interface has also been extended,
providing a wealth of new features, and short-cuts for some operations which
were felt to be excessively cumbersome in the original.

<P>
The motivation behind PyXPlot's creation was the apparent lack of a free
plotting package which combined both high-quality output and a simple
interface.  Some - pgplot for one - provided very attractive output, but
required a program to be written each time a plot was to be produced - a
potentially time consuming task. Others, gnuplot being the prime example, were
quick and simple to use, but produced less attractive results.

<P>
PyXPlot attempts to fill that gap, offering the best of both worlds. Though the
interface is based upon that of gnuplot, text is now rendered with all of the
beauty and flexibility of the <SPAN CLASS="logo,LaTeX">L<SUP><SMALL>A</SMALL></SUP>T<SMALL>E</SMALL>X</SPAN> typesetting environment; the
``multiplot'' environment is made massively more flexible, making it easy to
produce galleries of plots; and the range of possible output formats is
extended - to name but a few of the enhancements. A number of examples of the
results of which PyXPlot is capable can be seen in section&nbsp;<A HREF="node60.html#gallery">5.12</A>.

<P>
As well as the ease of use and flexibility of gnuplot's commandline interface
- it can be used either interactively, read a list of commands from a file, or
receive instructions through a UNIX pipe from another process - I believe it
to bring another distinct advantage. It insists upon data being written to a
datafile on disk before being plotted. Packages which allow, or more often
require, plotting to be done from within a programming language can encourage
the calculation of data and its plotting to occur in the same program. I
believe this to be a dangerous temptation, as the storage of raw datapoints to
disk can then often be seen as a secondary priority. Months later, when the
need arises to replot the same data in a different form, or to compare it with
newer data, remembering how to use a hurriedly written program can prove
tricky, but remembering how to plot a simple datafile less so.

<P>
The similarity of the interface to that of gnuplot is such that simple scripts
written for gnuplot should work with PyXPlot with minimal modification; gnuplot
users should be able to get started very quickly.  However, as PyXPlot remains
work in progress, it supports only a subset of the functionality and
configurability of gnuplot, and some features may be found to be missing.
These will be discussed further in section&nbsp;<A HREF="node17.html#missing_features">2.9</A>. A
description of those features which have been added to the interface can be
found in chapter&nbsp;<A HREF="node18.html#new_features">3</A>.

<P>
A brief overview of gnuplot's interface is provided for novice users in
chapter&nbsp;<A HREF="node8.html#gnuplot_intro">2</A>. However, the attention of past gnuplot users is
drawn to one of the key changes to the interface - namely that all textual
labels on plots are now printed using the <SPAN CLASS="logo,LaTeX">L<SUP><SMALL>A</SMALL></SUP>T<SMALL>E</SMALL>X</SPAN> typesetting environment. This
does unfortunately introduce some incompatibility with the original, since some
strings which were valid before are no longer valid. For example:

<P>
<PRE>set xlabel 'x^2'
</PRE>

<P>
would have been valid in gnuplot, but now needs to be written in
<SPAN CLASS="logo,LaTeX">L<SUP><SMALL>A</SMALL></SUP>T<SMALL>E</SMALL>X</SPAN> mathmode as:<A NAME="tex2html1"
  HREF="footnode.html#foot1975"><SUP><SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN></SUP></A>
<P>
<PRE>set xlabel '$x^2$'
</PRE>

<P>
It is the view of the author, however, that the nuisance of this
incompatibility is far outweighed by the power that <SPAN CLASS="logo,LaTeX">L<SUP><SMALL>A</SMALL></SUP>T<SMALL>E</SMALL>X</SPAN> brings. Users with
no prior knowledge of <SPAN CLASS="logo,LaTeX">L<SUP><SMALL>A</SMALL></SUP>T<SMALL>E</SMALL>X</SPAN> are advised that they don't know what they're
missing, and that they should straight away download and read a copy of Tobias
Oetiker's excellent introduction, <SPAN  CLASS="textit">The Not So Short Guide to <SPAN CLASS="logo,LaTeX">L<SUP><SMALL>A</SMALL></SUP>T<SMALL>E</SMALL>X</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
