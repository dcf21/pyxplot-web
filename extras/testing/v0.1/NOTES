The setup is as follows:

* Each test is contained within a directory, which contains:
  - A configuration file
  - A test script (either test.ppl or test.sh)
  - A .pyxplotrc (optional)
  - Data files needed for the test (optional)

* The confiuguration file contains:
  - A list of output files to be checked, specifying:
    + Their name (field name:)
    + Their type (text, eps, binary) (field type:)
    + Any regexes to be excluded from the (field exclude:, optional, can have >1)
  - A list of notes about what the test is checking for (this entry terminates the config file)

* The test script:
 - If named test.ppl, will be evaluated using PYXPLOT test.ppl > output 2> errors
 - If named test.sh, will firstly be parsed and occurances of PYXPLOT changed to the correct pyxplot binary, then executed > output 2> errors

* Command line options
  - Should be passed as name=value,value2,...
  - pyxplot: Change path to binary to be tested ("pyxplot8" by default)
  - run: List of test directories to be run
  - compare: List of test directories to compare
  - version: Name of the current version of pyxplot
  - compareversion: Name of the version to compare against
  - scriptdir: directory containing library of tests (input)
  - workdir: directory containing set of executed tests (output)

* Naming of tests
  - Six-digit numbers
  - First three digits are the thing being tested
    + 0xx: Basic functionality
    + 1xx: Mathematics
    + 2xx: Set/show
  - Second three digits are the test number
