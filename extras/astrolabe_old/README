The files in this directory are used to produce various parts of a cut-out
astrolabe. Two versions of the astrolabe can be produced: a version which is
faithful to the description given in Eisner (1975, 1976a, 1976b), and a
modernised version which might be more appropriate for outreach work.

The following software is required:

- PyXPlot (version 0.8.0 or higher)
- python (2.3+)
- latex
- gnu make

The files in this directory are as follows:



1. Scripts for automatically making the astrolabe


1.1. RunAll.py

A top level python script, which makes lots of pdf kits for building astrolabes
for a variety of northern latitudes, at five degree intervals.


1.2. Makefile

Makes two pdf files, containing the two versions of the astrolabe. The output
is sent to the files astrolabe.pdf and astrolabe2.pdf. The latitude for which
the astrolabes should be computed should be set in the environment variable
LATITUDE, for example:

export LATITUDE=52
make



2. LaTeX documents for producing an astrolabe kit for a single latitude

2.1 astrolabe.tex , astrolabe2.tex

These are two LaTeX source files for making booklets containing diagrams of the
various parts of the astrolabe. They assume that the PyXPlot scripts below have
been run.


3. data files

The following data files are taken verbatim from elsewhere:

bright_stars.dat -- The Yale Bright Star Catalogue
bright_star_names.dat -- The names of some of the stars
tuckerman.dat -- Tuckerman tables, taken from Eisner



4. python scripts for munging data into a form that PyXPlot can plot

The following python scripts must be run before any of the PyXPlot scripts
below; the generate data files in a form that PyXPlot can accept:

mother_back_text.py
rete_text.py



5. PyXPlot scripts for producing EPS images of parts of the astrolabe

5.1. mother_simple.ppl , plate_simple.ppl

These are PyXPlot scripts which make the plate and the mother of the simplified
version of the astrolabe.


5.2. mother.ppl , plate.ppl

These are PyXPlot scripts which make the plate and the mother of the Eisner
astrolabe.


5.3. rule.ppl , rete.ppl

These are PyXPlot scripts which make the rule and the rete, which are shared
between the two versions of the astrolabe.
