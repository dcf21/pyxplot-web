14:58 <TheSpoon> This be a blessing and a curse upon all ye PyXPlot users.
14:58 <TheSpoon> Follow the statutes of the PyXPlot manual, and thou shalt plot 
                 one dataset, and thou shalt find five plotted.
14:59 <TheSpoon> Thou shalt shew thy supervisor one plot, and it shall wax 
                 greater in his eyes than the 25 that thy neighbour didst show 
                 him.
14:59 <TheSpoon> But, my children, if thou follow not my Statutes.
15:00 <TheSpoon> The datasets which before thou could plot will be taken away 
                 from thee.
15:00 <TheSpoon> Thy tracebacks shall abound.
15:01 <TheSpoon> Thou shalt show thy supervisor thy 100 plots, but he shall 
                 tell thee that thy model be not physically realistic, and 
                 shall laugh thee to scorn.
15:01 <TheSpoon> Thy days shall be passed in cursings and gnashings.
15:01 <TheSpoon> Condor shalst thou use to run thy jobs.
15:02 <TheSpoon> and in TCL shall thou write thy code.
