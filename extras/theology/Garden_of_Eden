19:46 <TheSpoon> In the cool of the day, TheSpoon was walking in the garden,
                 and he called until wham2001 "where art thou?".
19:46 <TheSpoon> and wham2001 didst reply "I was hating and stabbing gnuplot".
19:46 <TheSpoon> and TheSpoon said unto wham2001 "How didst thou know that thou
                 didst hateth gnuplot?"
19:47 <TheSpoon> Cursed be thou above all of the livestock, and all of the
                 fowls of the air.
