21:43 < TheSpoon> Mmm. Whilst putting a book back on my bookshelf, a copy of the gnuplot manual just fell down and hit me on the head. What is the meaning of this???
21:45 < wham2009> I think it's a Sign.
21:45 < wham2009> That to those who walk in the path of the gnuplot, there is only pain and suffering.
21:46 < wham2009> And a plague of manuals falling from the sky.
21:46 < wham2009> Cursed be they, and cursed by their plots, yay even unto the seventh iteration of their papers.
21:47 < wham2009> Whereas to those that have seen the light, good things will abound.
21:48 < wham2009> Their PyXPlot manuals shall dwell happily within the bonkers Swedish ringbinders of their stationary cupboards, and stay fixed on their shelves for eternity.
21:49 < wham2009> And from the sky shall fall only mana, and quails, and dimensionally consistent results.
21:50 < wham2009> Repent now whilst there is still time!  For the hour is nigh.
21:50 < wham2009> Here endeth the lesson.
