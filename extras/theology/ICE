Dear Herr Rosibald,
                   See the ICE how it doth roxor most exceedingly, like PyXPlot
0.8 compared to PyXPlot 0.7 it has waxed great!  Blessings be upon thee in the
name of the major axis ticks, the minor axis ticks and the holy gridlines, all
of the same substance, begotten of the lineto command not created, Level II
postscript without end.  Keep strong in the faith and remember thou the CPU
cycles which were dead and buried for the sake of PyXPlot 0.7; drink thou LBV
in remembrance of them.  For didst they not rise again to form plots which
didst roxor the world?  Be thou watchful.  The day when the new PyXPlot shall
come draws nigh, and then axis label shall be placed above minor axis tick and
arrow shall be placed above Tycho-Brahe-styled datapoints.  Be thou prepared
for time is short.

                   Rear Admiral Spoon
