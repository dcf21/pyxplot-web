<p class="newshead">Pyxplot 0.9.0 released</p>
<p class="newsbody">
Version 0.9 is a major update. Many <b>new data types</b> have been introduced,
each of which has methods which can be called in an <b>object-orientated</b>
fashion. These include:
</p>

<ul class="newsbody">
<li> <b>Colors</b>, which can be stored in variables for subsequent use in vector graphics commands. The addition and subtraction operators act on colors to allow color mixing.</li>
<li> <b>Dates</b>, which can be imported from calendar dates, unix times or Julian dates. Dates can be subtracted to give time intervals.</li>
<li> <b>Lists</b> and <b>dictionaries</b>, which can be iterated over, or used to feed calculated data into the plot and tabulate commands.</li>
<li> <b>Vectors</b> and <b>matrices</b>, which allow matrix algebra. These types interface cleanly with Pyxplot's vector-graphics commands, allowing positions to be specified as vector expressions.</li>
<li> <b>File handles</b>, which allow Pyxplot to read data from files, or write data or logs to files.</li>
<li> <b>Modules</b> and <b>classes</b>, which allow object-orientated programming.</li>
</ul>

<p class="newsbody">
In addition, Pyxplot's range of <b>operators</b> has been <b>extended</b> to include most of those in the C programming language, allowing expressions such as
</p>

<p class="newsbody" style="font-family: monospace;">
<b>
pyxplot&gt; print (a=3)+(b=2)<br />

pyxplot&gt; print a&gt;0?"yes":"no"<br />

pyxplot&gt; print "%s %s"%(++a,b++)<br />
