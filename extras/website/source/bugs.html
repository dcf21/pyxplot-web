<h3>Bugs</h3>

<p>

We welcome bug reports, which can be filed using our <b><a
href="https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=350556">bug tracker</a></b> on
SourceForge.  We also welcome feedback and feature requests, which can be
submitted to our <b><a
href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/pyxplot/forums">discussion
forums</a></b>, also hosted by SourceForge.

</p>
<p>

You can also <b>get involved</b> and help us. PyXPlot is developed by a small
number of volunteers in our spare time, and between our day jobs and busily
developing the next version of PyXPlot, we rarely have the time to provide
support to individual users.  If you see questions on our user forum that you
know the answer to, why not jump in and help?

</p>
<p>

If you're submitting a bug report, there are ways you can help us deal with it
as quickly as possible. First, please check that your bug or feature request
has not already been submitted, before opening a new thread on the forum. Then,
try and find the <b>shortest possible script</b> that reproduces the your bug.
Usually, it is possible to reproduce a bug in fewer than ten lines of script;
often fewer than five are needed. Tell us exactly how the script's output is
wrong.  If there's an error message, make sure you include it. That will help
us to pin down your problem as quickly as possible.

As a last resort, the developers can be contacted via <a
