<P>
Gnuplot has a plotting mode called ``multiplot'' which allows many graphs to be
plotted together, and display side-by-side. The basic syntax of this mode is
reproduced in Pyxplot, but is hugely extended.

<P>
The mode is entered by the command ``<TT>set multiplot</TT>''. This can be compared
to taking a blank sheet of paper on which to place plots. Plots are then placed
on that sheet of paper, as usual, with the <TT>plot</TT> command. The position
of each plot is set using the <TT>set origin</TT> command, which takes a
comma-separated <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="31" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img42.png"
 ALT="$ x,y$"></SPAN> coordinate pair, measured in centimetres. The following,
for example, would plot a graph of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="49" HEIGHT="35" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img6.png"
 ALT="$ \sin(x)$"></SPAN> to the left of a plot of
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="51" HEIGHT="35" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img43.png"
 ALT="$ \cos(x)$"></SPAN>:<A NAME="2054"></A>

<P>
<PRE> 
set multiplot
plot sin(x)
set origin 10,0
plot cos(x)
</PRE>

<P>
The multiplot page may subsequently be cleared with the <TT>clear</TT> command,
and multiplot mode may be left using the ``<TT>set nomultiplot</TT>''
command.<A NAME="2055"></A>

<P>
At this point we move beyond the syntax available in gnuplot. Each time a plot
is placed on the multiplot page in Pyxplot, it is allocated a reference number,
which is output to the terminal. Reference numbers count up from zero each time
the multiplot page is cleared. A number of commands exist for modifying plots
after they have been placed on the page, selecting them by making reference to
their reference numbers.

<P>
Plots may be removed from the page with the <TT>delete</TT> command, and
restored with the <TT>undelete</TT> command:<A NAME="2056"></A><A NAME="2057"></A>

<P>
<PRE> 
delete &lt;number&gt;
undelete &lt;number&gt;
</PRE>

<P>
The reference numbers of deleted plots are not reused until the page is
cleared, as they may always be restored with the <TT>undelete</TT> command;
plots which have been deleted simply do not appear.

<P>
Plots may also be moved with the <TT>move</TT> command. For example, the
following would move plot 23 to position (8,8) measured in centimetres:

<P>
<PRE> 
move 23 8,8
</PRE>

<P>
The axes of plots can be linked together, in such a way that they always share
a common scale. This can be useful when placing plots next to one another,
firstly, of course, if it is of intrinsic interest to ensure that they are on a
common scale, but also because the two plots then do not both need their own
axis labels, and space can be saved by one sharing the labels from the other.
In Pyxplot, an axis which borrows its scale and labels from another is called a
``linked axis''.

<P>
Such axes are declared by setting the label of the linked axis to a magic
string such as ``<TT>linkaxis 0</TT>''<A NAME="linked_axes"></A><A NAME="835"></A><A NAME="836"></A>. This magic label would set the axis to borrow
its scale from an axis from plot zero. The general syntax is
``<TT>linkaxis</TT> <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="15" HEIGHT="15" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img11.png"
 ALT="$ n$"></SPAN> <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="15" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img44.png"
 ALT="$ m$"></SPAN>'', where <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="15" HEIGHT="15" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img11.png"
 ALT="$ n$"></SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="15" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img44.png"
 ALT="$ m$"></SPAN> are two integers, separated by
a comma or whitespace. The first, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="15" HEIGHT="15" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img11.png"
 ALT="$ n$"></SPAN>, indicates the plot from which to borrow
an axis; the second, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="15" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img44.png"
 ALT="$ m$"></SPAN>, indicates whether to borrow the scale of axis <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="23" HEIGHT="15" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img45.png"
 ALT="$ x1$"></SPAN>,
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="23" HEIGHT="15" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img23.png"
 ALT="$ x2$"></SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="23" HEIGHT="15" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img31.png"
 ALT="$ x3$"></SPAN>, etc. By default, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="52" HEIGHT="15" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img46.png"
 ALT="$ m=1$"></SPAN>. The linking will fail, and a warning
result, if an attempt is made to link to an axis which doesn't exist.

<P>
The specimen plots in section&nbsp;<A HREF="node60.html#gallery">5.12</A> show numerous examples of the use
of linked axes.

<P>
In multiplot mode, the <TT>replot</TT> command can be used to modify the last
plot added to the page. For example, the following would change the title of
the latest plot to ``foo'', and add a plot of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="51" HEIGHT="35" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img43.png"
 ALT="$ \cos(x)$"></SPAN> to it:

<P>
<PRE> 
set title 'foo'
replot cos(x)
</PRE>

<P>
Additionally, it is possible to modify any plot on the page, by first selecting
it with the <TT>edit</TT> command. Subsequently, the <TT>replot</TT> will act
upon the selected plot. The following example would produce two plots, and then
change the colour of the text on the first:

<P>
<PRE> 
set multiplot
plot sin(x)
set origin 10,0
plot cos(x)
edit 0        # Select the first plot ...
set textcolour red
replot        # ... and replot it.
</PRE>

<P>
The <TT>edit</TT> command can also be used to view the settings which are
applied to any plot on the multiplot page - after executing ``edit 0'', the
<TT>show</TT> command will show the settings applied to plot zero.

<P>
When a new plot is added to the page, <TT>replot</TT> always switches to act
upon this most recent plot.

<P>
<A NAME="text_command"></A><A NAME="2058"></A> In addition to
placing plots on the multiplot page, text labels may also be inserted
independently of any plots, using the <TT>text</TT> command. This has the
following syntax:

<P>
<PRE> 
text 'This is some text' x,y
</PRE>

<P>
In this case, the string ``This is some text'' would be rendered at position
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="45" HEIGHT="35" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img47.png"
 ALT="$ (x,y)$"></SPAN> on the multiplot. The commands <TT>set textcolour</TT>, <TT>set
texthalign</TT> and <TT>set textvalign</TT>, which have already been described in
the context in the <TT>set label</TT> command, can also be used to set the
colour and alignment of text produced with the <TT>text</TT> command.<A NAME="2059"></A><A NAME="2060"></A><A NAME="2061"></A>. A useful application of this is to
produce centred headings at the top of multiplots.

<P>
As with plots, each text item has a unique identification number, and can be
moved around, deleted or undeleted:

<P>
<A NAME="2062"></A>
<A NAME="2063"></A>
<PRE> 
delete_text &lt;number&gt;
undelete_text &lt;number&gt;
move_text &lt;number&gt; x,y
</PRE>

<P>
It should be noted that the <TT>text</TT> command can also be used outside of
the multiplot environment, to render a single piece of short text instead of a
graph. This has limited applications, but one is illustrated in
section&nbsp;<A HREF="node52.html#powerpoint_example">5.4</A>.

<P>
<A NAME="arrows"></A> <A NAME="2064"></A> Arrows may also be
placed on multiplot pages, independently of any plots, using the <TT>arrow</TT>
command, which has syntax:

<P>
<PRE> 
arrow from x,y to x,y
</PRE>

<P>
As above, arrows receive unique identification numbers, and can be deleted and
undeleted, though they cannot be moved:

<P>
<A NAME="2065"></A>
<A NAME="2066"></A>
<PRE>
delete_arrow &lt;number&gt;
undelete_arrow &lt;number&gt;
</PRE>

<P>
The <TT>arrow</TT> command may be followed by the `<TT>with</TT>' keyword to
specify to style of the arrow. The style keywords which are accepted are
identical to those accepted by the <TT>set arrow</TT> command (see
section&nbsp;<A HREF="node28.html#set_arrow">3.4.1</A>). For example:

<P>
<PRE> 
arrow from x1,y1 to x2,y2 \
with twohead colour red
</PRE>

<P>
<A NAME="2067"></A><A NAME="884"></A>
<A NAME="2068"></A> The <TT>refresh</TT> command is
rather similar to the <TT>replot</TT> command, but produces an exact copy of
the latest display. This can be useful, for example, after changing the
terminal type, to produce a second copy of a multiplot page in a different
format. But the crucial difference between this command and <TT>replot</TT> is
that it doesn't replot anything. Indeed, there could be only textual items and
arrows on the present multiplot page, and no graphs <SPAN  CLASS="textit">to</SPAN> replot.
