<p>The inspiration for PyXPlot came from two sources, to which PyXPlot owes a considerable historical debt. PyXPlot’s interface was heavily motivated by Gnuplot’s simple and intuitive interface, which was devised by Thomas Williams and Colin Kelley and has more recently been developed by many others. PyXPlot’s graphical output engine was heavily motivated by the PyX<a name="a0000000261" id="a0000000261"></a> graphics library for Python, originally written by Jörg Lehmann and André Wobst and more recently developed by a larger team. Versions of PyXPlot prior to <img src="images/img-0012.png" alt="$0.8$" style="vertical-align:0px; 
                                     width:23px; 
                                     height:12px" class="math gen" /> used PyX to produce their graphical output, and though version <img src="images/img-0012.png" alt="$0.8$" style="vertical-align:0px; 
                                     width:23px; 
                                     height:12px" class="math gen" /> uses its own graphics engine, it continues to bear many similarities to PyX. </p><p>Several other people have made very substantial contributions to PyXPlot’s development. Matthew Smith provided extensive advice on many mathematical matters which arose during its development, provided C implementations of the Airy functions and the Riemann zeta function for general complex inputs, and suggested many other mathematical functions which ought to be made available. Dave Ansell provided many good ideas which have helped to shape PyXPlot’s interface. The writing of PyXPlot’s PostScript engine was substantially eased thanks to the help of Michael Rutter, who happily shared his code and past experiences with us; the implementation of the <tt class="tt">image</tt> command is substantially his work. </p><p>We are also very grateful to our team of alpha testers, without whose work this release of PyXPlot would doubtless contain many more bugs than it does: especial thanks go to Rachel Holdforth and Stuart Prescott. Of course, the authors remain solely responsible for any bugs which remain. </p><p>Finally, we would like to think all of the users who have got in touch with us by email since PyXPlot was first released on the web in 2006. Your feedback and suggestions have been gratefully received. </p></div>
