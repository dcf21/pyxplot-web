<h3>Bugs</h3>
	Please report bugs in PyXPlot to the authors using our <a
href="https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=350556">bugtracker</a> on
SourceForge.  We welcome feedback and feature requests, which can be submitted
to our <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/pyxplot/forums">discussion
forums</a>.  Please note that our time is very limited, and that we may not be
able to respond right away. You can help us by making sure that your bug or
feature request has not already been submitted before opening a new thread.
Where possible, please do not submit long PyXPlot scripts as bug reports;
instead, please submit the shortest script which you can find which reproduces
the failure. This will help us to fix your problem as quickly as possible.

As a last resort, the developers can be contacted via <a
href="mailto:coders@pyxplot.org.uk">email</a>.
