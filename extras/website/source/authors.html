<p>
Pyxplot builds on ideas from several pre-existing open-source software
projects. We like gnuplot's simple and intuitive interface, and Pyxplot's
command syntax is intentionally very similar, to the point of backwards
compatibility in many cases. Even when designing the entirely new parts of
Pyxplot's syntax, we have followed gnuplot's preference for short simple
command-line syntax. In designing Pyxplot's graphical output engine, we
borrowed many ideas from the <a href="http://pyx.sourceforge.net/">PyX</a>
graphics library for Python.
</p>

<p>
Several people have contributed code to Pyxplot. <a
href="http://www.tcm.phy.cam.ac.uk/~mjr/">Michael Rutter</a> provided us with a
copy of his public domain code for converting bitmap images into PostScript,
which we used in the implementation of the image command and the colormap plot
style. Matthew Smith provided C implementations of the Airy functions and the
Riemann zeta function for general complex inputs, and helped to test Pyxplot's
mathematical environment. <a
href="http://pyxplot-tricks.blogspot.com">Zolt&#225n V&#246r&#246s</a> worked
on our development team from 2010 until 2011.  <a
href="http://www.fourmilab.ch/documents/specrend/">John Walker</a> has
published public domain code which renders the electromagnetic spectrum as RGB
colors, which we use in the colors.wavelength() function.
</p>

<p>
We would also like to thank all the users who have got in touch with us by email
since Pyxplot was first released on the web in 2006. Your feedback and
suggestions have been gratefully received.
</p>

<p>
Final thanks go to our team of alpha testers, without whose work Pyxplot would
doubtless still contain many more bugs. Especial thanks go to Rachel Holdforth
and <a

Prescott</a>.
