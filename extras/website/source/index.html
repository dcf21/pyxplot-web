PyXPlot is a multi-purpose command-line tool for performing simple data
processing and for producing graphs and vector graphics. The central philosophy
of PyXPlot's interface is that common tasks -- for example, plotting labelled
graphs of data -- should be accessible via short, simple and intuitive commands
which require minimal typing to produce a first draft result.  At the same
time, these commands also take a sufficient range of optional arguments and
settings to allow these figures to be subsequently fine-tuned into a wide range
of different styles, appropriate for inclusion in reports, talks or academic
journals.

As well as being a graph-plotting package, PyXPlot also has facilities for
fitting mathematical functions to data, for numerically solving simple systems
of equations, and for converting datafiles between different formats.  Its
mathematical environment can interpolate datasets, integrate and differentiate
them, and take Fourier transforms.  PyXPlot's ability to keep track of the
physical units in which data are expressed, and to convert data between
different units of measurement, mean that it can be used as a powerful desktop
calculator.
