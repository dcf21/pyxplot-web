			PyXPlot is a multi-purpose command-line tool for performing
			simple data processing and for producing graphs and vector
			graphics. The central philosophy of PyXPlot’s interface is that
			common tasks – for example, plotting graphs of data from files
			and then performing simple manipulations on them – should be
			accessible via short, simple and intuitive commands which
			require minimal typing to produce a first draft result. At the
			same time, these commands aim to take a sufficient range of
			optional arguments and settings to allow them, after some
			tweaking, to produce figures in a wide range of styles, which
			are amply neat enough to include in reports, talks or academic
			journals.
		</p>
		<p>
			PyXPlot is suitable for a wide range of data processing and
			visualisation tasks. It is a graph plotting package, but also
			has facilities for fitting best-fit curves to data, for
			numerically solving simple systems of equations, for con-
			verting data files between different formats, and is also a
			remarkably powerful desktop calculator which can keep track of
			the physical dimensions of variables and convert between
			different units of measurement – for example, between inches and
			centimetres.

			The plots below give a taster of some of the things that PyXPlot
			is capable of, more of which can be found in the <a
