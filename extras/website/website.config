  caption: A simple plot of a data file
  notes: A simple example of a script to plot data from a file.  The <tt>using</tt> modifier is utilized to select the fourth and fifth columns, and axis labels rendered as equations within LaTeX.

  caption: A rather more complicated plot to show off multiple axes and LaTeXed labels on plots.
  notes: We plot two datafiles, one with a line, and another with points. We label our lines using arrows and text labels.  We also have multiple axes, this time having three <i>x</i>-axes on the same plot.

  caption: A demonstration of the use of the <tt>multiplot</tt> setting to place multiple plots on a single page.
  notes: In this example, the multiplot environment is used to produce a gallery of several plots. The <tt>set origin</tt> command is used to position each one. We also make use of multiple <i>y</i>-axes in the top-left plot: the functions sin(<i>x</i>) and sin<sup>2</sup>(<i>x</i>) are plotted together, but on different <i>y</i> scales.

  caption: An illustration of how to link the axes of plots on a multiplot.
  notes: This example illustrates how to link the axes of plots on a multiplot so that they share a common scale.  It also demonstrates how to set the colours of datasets using the <tt>with colour</tt> plot modifier. In the top-right panel, we also make use of the multiplot environment to add a plot inset.  Finally we render this plot using the <tt>landscape</tt> terminal setting, showing how to fit more plot onto a sheet of paper.
