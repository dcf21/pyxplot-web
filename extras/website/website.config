  caption: A plot of projectile trajectories
  notes: This plot shows the trajectories of various projectiles, projected with different velocities and angles from the horizontal. The velocities are specified in physical units using PyXPlot's built-in unit system.

  caption: A diagram from Euclid's elements illustrating Pythagoras' theorem
  notes: In this more extended example script, PyXPlot's arrow and text commands are used to produce a diagram illustrating the 47th Proposition from Euclid's First Book of Elements, better known as Pythagoras' Theorem. A full text of the proof which accompanies this diagram can be found at http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/21076.

  caption: A labelled diagram of an ellipse
  notes: Here, an ellipse of moderate eccentricity <i>e</i> is drawn using PyXPlot's <tt>ellipse</tt> command, and then its important features are labelled. The semi-major axis <i>a</i> and semi-minor axis <i>b</i> are both marked, as well as the semi-latus rectum <i>L</i>.
