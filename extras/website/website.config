  notes: As a simple first example, we plot two trigonometric functions.

  datafile: scripts/data/data.dat
  caption: A simple plot of a data file
  notes: A simple example of a script to plot data from a file.  The <tt>using</tt> modifier is utilized to select the fourth and fifth columns, and axis labels rendered as equations within LaTeX.

  caption: A rather more complicated plot to show off multiple axes and LaTeXed labels on plots.
  notes: We plot two datafiles, one with a line, and another with points. We label our lines using arrows and text labels.  We also have multiple axes, this time having three <i>x</i>-axes on the same plot.

  script: scripts/firststeps-multiplot.ppl
  caption: A demonstration of the use of the <tt>multiplot</tt> setting to place multiple plots on a single page.
  notes: In this example, the multiplot environment is used to produce a gallery of several plots. The <tt>set origin</tt> command is used to position each one. We also make use of multiple <i>y</i>-axes in the top-left plot: the functions sin(<i>x</i>) and sin<sup>2</sup>(<i>x</i>) are plotted together, but on different <i>y</i> scales.

  caption: An illustration of how to link the axes of plots on a multiplot.
  notes: This example illustrates how to link the axes of plots on a multiplot so that they share a common scale.  It also demonstrates how to set the colours of datasets using the <tt>with colour</tt> plot modifier. In the top-right panel, we also make use of the multiplot environment to add a plot inset.  Finally we render this plot using the <tt>landscape</tt> terminal setting, showing how to fit more plot onto a sheet of paper.

  caption: A plot of projectile trajectories
  notes: This plot shows the trajectories of various projectiles, projected with different velocities and angles from the horizontal.  Note that the velocities have been specified in physical units using PyXPlot's built-in unit system.  A key is also provided, with mathematical symbols rendered using LaTeX.

  notes: This plot shows the function exp(x)sin(1/x) over the small region where it is well-behaved.  The tics on the second x axis are provided to show the range of attractive ticking possibilites that are available in PyXPlot.

  notes: In this example we draw an ellipse of moderate eccentricity <i>e</i>using PyXPlot's ellipse command, and then label its important features.  The semi-major axis <i>a</i> and semi-minor axis <i>b</i> are both shown, as well as the semi-latus rectum <i>L</i>.

  caption: A diagram from Euclid's elements illustrating Pythagoras' theorem
  notes: In this more extended example script, we use PyXPlot's arrow and text commands to produce a diagram illustrating the 47th Proposition from Euclid's First Book of Elements, better known as Pythagoras' Theorem. A full text of the proof which accompanies this diagram can be found at http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/21076.
