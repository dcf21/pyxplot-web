  caption: A plot with multiple horizontal axes with linked scales
  notes: This example uses the <tt>set axis ... linked</tt> command to create a plot with multiple horizontal axes, whose scales are linked by algebraic expressions. In this application, the scales indicate wavelength of light, frequency of light, and photon energy along an electromagnetic spectrum. Against these axes are plotted blackbody spectra of five different temperatures <i>T</i>, generated using Pyxplot's built-in function for evaluating the Planck formula, <tt>Bv(nu,T)</tt>. The command <tt>set unit of ...</tt> is used to specified that energies should be measured in electronvolts, and frequencies in hertz.

The top axis is then used to mark significant points in the function plotted, in this case the points where it equals zero.

This behaviour could, however, have been changed using a command such as <tt>set unit of length inches</tt>. The <tt>set key outside</tt> command is used to position the plot's key on its right-hand side.

  caption: A parametric plot of a spirograph pattern
  notes: In this example, spirograph patterns are generated as an example of a parametric plot. Rather than plotting some function <tt>f(x)</tt> against the vertical axis, as a function of <tt>x</tt>, two expressions are given for <tt>x(t)</tt> and <tt>y(t)</tt> as a function of some variable <tt>t</tt>, which is varied over the range specified in the <tt>set trange</tt> command.</p><p>Spirograph patterns are produced when a pen is tethered to the end of a rod which rotates at some angular speed omega_1 about the end of another rod, which is itself rotating at some angular speed omega_2 about a fixed central point. Spirographs are commonly implemented mechanically as wheels within wheels, but in this example we implement them using parametric functions which are simply the sum of two circular motions with angular velocities inversely proportional to their radii. The complexity of the resulting spirograph pattern depends upon how rapidly the rods return to their starting configuration; if the two chosen angular speeds for the rods have a large lowest common multiple, then a highly complicated pattern will result. In this example we pick a ratio of 8:15.

The <tt>arrows</tt> plotting style takes four columns of input: the (x,y) position of the start of each arrow, and the (x,y) position of the end of each arrow.</p><p>In this example we assume for simplicity that the fluid in the core of the vortex, at radii r<1, is undergoing solid body rotation with velocity proportional to radius, and that the fluid outside this core is behaving as a free vortex with velocity proportional to 1/r. We plot a dotted line around the core of the vortex using the parametric equation of a circle.

Rather than plotting some function <tt>f(x)</tt> against the vertical axis, as a function of <tt>x</tt>, two expressions are given for <tt>x(t)</tt> and <tt>y(t)</tt> as a function of some variable <tt>t</tt>, which is varied over the range specified in the <tt>set trange</tt> command.</p><p>In addition we use Pyxplot's built-in functions for numerical integration to evaluate a curve known as the Cornu spiral. A legend is displayed beneath the plot, and Pyxplot automatically generates neat algebraic representation of the expressions plotted, in this case converting evaluations of its numerical integration functions into integral signs.

  notes: In this example application of Pyxplot, we use some of its built-in mathematical functions -- arcsines and Jacobi functions -- to plot the motion of a pendulum which is swinging with an amplitude of 60 degrees. The black lines shows the motion predicted under the assumption of simple harmonic motion, while the red line shows the pendulum's true motion. The small angle approximation is not very good for a pendulum swinging through such a large angle.

  caption: A demonstration of Pyxplot's in-built cosmology functions, and of an axis with a custom non-linear scale
  notes: This example demonstrates the use of two horizontal axes with linked scales, one of which is displayed along the top of the plot and the other along the bottom. In this case the expression used to link the scales of the two axes, specified using the <tt>set axis linked ...</tt> command, is one of Pyxplot's specialist cosmology functions, <tt>ast.Lcdm_z()</tt>, which converts between time since the Big Bang (axis <tt>x1</tt>) and observed cosmological redshift (axis <tt>x2</tt>). It does not matter that this conversion is highly non-linear.</p><p>We use these axes produce a plot of the temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMBR) as a function of time since the Big Bang, and redshift. Because the temperature of the CMBR is most easily expressed as a function of redshift, we plot this function against axis <tt>x2</tt>.

  leafname: Fibonacci_sequence

  script: scripts/functions-fibonacci.ppl
  caption: An example of the use of function splicing, to compute Fibonacci numbers
  notes: The Fibonacci numbers are defined to be the sequence of numbers in which each member is the sum of its two immediate predecessors, and the first three members of the sequence are {0,1,1}. Thus, the sequence runs {0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,...}. In this example, we use function splicing to calculate the Fibonacci sequence in an iterative and highly inefficient way, hard-coding the first three members of the sequence and then using the knowledge that all of the subsequent members are the sums of their two immediate predecessors.</p><p>This method is highly inefficient because each evaluation spawns two further evaluations of the function, and so the number of operations required to evaluate f(x) scales as 2^x.  It is inadvisable to evaluate it for x>25 unless you're prepared for a long wait.</p><p>A much more efficient method of calculating the Fibonacci numbers is to use Binet's formula, which provides an analytic expression for the sequence.  In the following script, we compare the values returned by these two implementations. We enable complex arithmetic as Binet's formula returns complex numbers for non-integer values of x.

In the string <tt>d ps 3</tt>, the <tt>d</tt> is an abbreviation of <tt>dots</tt>, meanwhile <tt>ps</tt> is short for <tt>pointsize</tt> and sets the dots to be a size so that they show up clearly.</p><p>The result is a Hertzsprung-Russell (HR) diagram, which is a scatter-plot that reveals that most normal stars lie along a tight line called the main sequence, whilst unusual classes of stars -- giants and dwarfs -- can be readily identified on account of their not lying along this main sequence. In the diagram above, five white dwarf stars can clearly be identified in the bottom left corner of the plot.

A birefringent material is one, like stressed plastic, through which light travels at different speeds depending on its polarisation direction. That is, the material has a different refractive index depending upon the polarisation state of the light passing through it. When such a material is placed between crossed polars, an interference pattern is produced, which we plot here by writing down an expression for the spectrum of light emerging from the wedge after interference, as a function of the wedge's thickness.

  notes: The Newton fractal for the polynomial z**3-1, plotted using the colormap plot style. In addition to coloring points red, green or blue depending upon which root of the polynomial the Newton-Raphson iteration converges to, we also assign points different brightnesses depending upon how long the iteration takes to converge.

  notes: In this example, we use Pyxplot's <tt>piechart</tt> command to produce a diagram of the composition of the Universe, showing that of the mass in the Universe, only 4% is in the form of the baryonic matter; the rest comprises 22% in the form of dark matter and 74% in the form of dark energy.
