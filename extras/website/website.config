  caption: A plot of several blackbodies of various temperatures
  notes: In this example we produce a plot of blackbody spectra for five different temperatures <i>T</i>, using the Planck formula which is evaluated in PyXPlot by the system-defined mathematical function <tt>Bv(nu,T)</tt>. We use the axis linkage commands to produce three parallel horizontal axes showing wavelength of light, frequency of light and photon energy.

  caption: A spirograph pattern
  notes: Spirograph patterns are produced when a pen is tethered to the end of a rod which rotates at some angular speed omega_1 about the end of another rod, which is itself rotating at some angular speed omega_2 about a fixed central point. Spirographs are commonly implemented mechanically as wheels within wheels -- epicycles within deferents, mathematically speaking -- but in this example we implement them using parametric functions which are simply the sum of two circular motions with angular velocities inversely proportional to their radii. The complexity of the resulting spirograph pattern depends upon how rapidly the rods return to their starting configuration; if the two chosen angular speeds for the rods have a large lowest common multiple, then a highly complicated pattern will result. In this example we pick a ratio of 8:15.

For simplicity, we assume that the fluid in the core of the vortex, at radii r<1, is undergoing solid body rotation with velocity proportional to radius, and that the fluid outside this core is behaving as a free vortex with velocity proportional to 1/r.

  notes: In this example we produce a plot of the temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMBR) as a function of time <i>t</i> since the Big Bang, on the <tt>x</tt>-axis, and equivalently as a function of redshift <i>z</i>, on the <tt>x2</tt>-axis.  The specialist cosmology function <tt>ast_Lcdm_z</tt>(<i>t</i>,<i>H_0</i>,<i>Omega_M</i>,<i>Omega_/\</i>) is used to make the highly non-linear conversion between time <i>t</i> and redshift <i>z</i>, adopting some standard values for the cosmological parameters <i>H_0</i>, <i>Omega_M</i> and <i>Omega_/\</i>. Because the temperature of the CMBR is most easily expressed as a function of redshift, we plot this function against axis <tt>x2</tt>.

  script: scripts/functions-fibonacci.ppl
  caption: The Fibonacci Sequence
  notes: The Fibonacci numbers are defined to be the sequence of numbers in which each member is the sum of its two immediate predecessors, and the first three members of the sequence are {0,1,1}. Thus, the sequence runs {0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,...}. In this example, we use function splicing to calculate the Fibonacci sequence in an iterative and highly inefficient way, hard-coding the first three members of the sequence and then using the knowledge that all of the subsequent members are the sums of their two immediate predecessors.</p><p>This method is highly inefficient because each evaluation spawns two further evaluations of the function, and so the number of operations required to evaluate f(x) scales as 2^x.  It is inadvisable to evaluate it for x>25 unless you're prepared for a long wait.</p><p>A much more efficient method of calculating the Fibonacci numbers is to use Binet's formula, which provides an analytic expression for the sequence.  In the following script, we compare the values returned by these two implementations. We enable complex arithmetic as Binet's formula returns complex numbers for non-integer values of x.

  caption: A Hertzsprung Russell Diagram
  notes: Hertzsprung-Russell (HR) Diagrams are scatter-plots of the luminosities of stars plotted against their colors which reveal that most normal stars lie along a tight line called the main sequence, whilst unusual classes of stars -- giants and dwarfs -- can be readily identified on account of their not lying along this main sequence. The principal difficulty in constructing accurate HR diagrams is that the luminosities <i>L</i> of stars can only be calculated from their observed brightnesses <i>F</i>, using the relation <i>L</i>=<i>Fd</i>^2 if their distances <i>d</i> are known. In this example, we construct an HR diagram using observations made by the European Space Agency's {\tt Hipparcos} spacecraft, which accurately measured the distances of over a million stars between 1989 and 1993.
