This document contains a series of images which should be printed and cut out
to make a simple cardboard version of a medieval astrolabe. The resulting
astrolabe is a simplified version of that described in Geoffrey Chaucer's 1391
{\it Treatise on the Astrolabe}, and has been constructed following the
prescription described in Eisner (1975, 1976a, 1976b). The diagrams in this
document have been produced using
PyXPlot.\footnote{\url{http://www.pyxplot.org.uk}}

Pages~2, 3, 4 and~6 should be printed out onto paper, or more preferably card.
Page~5 should be printed onto a sheet of transparent acetate. The two sides of
the Mother (pages~2 and~3) should be glued back-to-back on a piece of rigid
card. The Plate fits inside the space left in the centre of the front of the
Mother, with the tab at the top slotting into the corresponding gap in the
degrees scale on the Mother. A medieval astrolabe would have had many plates
prepared for different latitudes; we provide a single plate prepared for a
latitude of $52^\circ$N, suitable for use in northern Europe and the northern
USA. The Rete, printed onto transparent acetate, should be placed over the
Plate.  The Label and the Rule should be placed on either side of the
astrolabe: the Rule, marked out with a declination scale, should be placed over
the Plate and the Rete, whilst the Label should be placed on the back of the
Mother. The whole construction may then be fastened together by placing a
split-pin paper fastener through the centre.
