This document describes the electronic materials which accompany the author's
paper of the same title in the Journal of the British Astronomical Association.
It also contains images of all of the components which need to be printed out
to build a model astrolabe tailored for a latitude of $52^\circ$N. The
astrolabe presented in this document is a slightly modernised version of that
described in Geoffrey Chaucer's c.\ 1391 {\it Treatise on the Astrolabe}, and
has been constructed following a prescription similar to that described in
Eisner (1975, 1976a, 1976b).

The images and text in this document may be duplicated, redistributed and/or
modified under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the
Free Software Foundation; either version~2 of the License, or (at your option)
any later version. The only restriction placed on the duplication of this
document is that the copyright notices must remain intact.

\section*{Assembly Instructions}

To build a model astrolabe tailored for a latitude of $52^\circ$N,
Figures~\ref{mother_back}, \ref{mother_front} and~\ref{rule} should be printed
out onto paper, or more preferably onto thin card.  Figure~\ref{rete} should be
printed onto a sheet of transparent acetate.  The two sides of the {\it mother}
(Figures~\ref{mother_back} and~\ref{mother_front}) should be glued rigidly
back-to-back, perhaps sandwiching a piece of rigid card. The {\it r\^ete},
printed onto transparent acetate\footnote{Historically, the r\^ete would have
been made of the same material as the rest of the astrolabe and marked with
arrows showing the positions of prominent stars. As much of the material of the
r\^ete as possible would then have been cut away to allow the climate below to
be seen. We use transparent plastic here because it is so much more practical
than the traditional form of r\^ete.}, should be placed over the {\it climate},
which for simplicity is incorporated into the front of the mother in this
document.

The {\it rule} and the {\it alidade} should be placed on either side of the
astrolabe: the rule, marked out with a declination scale, should rotate over
the front of the mother; the alidade should rotate over the back of the mother.
The two tabs on the side of the alidade should be folded out to form a sight
used for measuring the altitudes of celestial and terrestrial objects.  The
whole construction may then finally be fastened together by placing a split-pin
paper fastener through the centre.

\section*{Astrolabes for Other Latitudes}

The components needed to build astrolabes tailored for latitudes other than
$52^\circ$N can be found in the electronic accompanying materials, which can be
downloaded from:
\vspace{1mm}\newline\noindent
\url{http://pyxplot.org.uk/astrolabe/astrolabe.tar.gz} (tarball)
\vspace{1mm}\newline\noindent or
\vspace{1mm}\newline\noindent
\url{http://pyxplot.org.uk/astrolabe/astrolabe.zip} (zip archive).
\vspace{1mm}\newline\noindent
The images are stored in the {\tt output} directory of this
archive, and each is available as encapsulated postscript ({\tt .eps}), as a
GIF bitmap image ({\tt .gif}), or in PDF format.  All of the required
components must be printed at exactly the same scale in order to be of
consistent sizes when fitted together. For example, the option to enlarge each
of the PDF documents to fit the page size must {\it not} be selected in the
printer setup options in Adobe Acrobat Reader, and the GIF images must be
printed at a common dots-per-inch resolution.

For latitudes in the northern hemisphere, the following images should be
printed:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\tt mother\_back.???} -- The back of the mother of the astrolabe. This image also appears in Figure~\ref{mother_back}, and is not latitude dependent.
\item {\tt mother\_front\_north.???} -- The front of the mother of a northern-hemi\-sp\-here astrolabe. Note that, in contrast to Figure~\ref{mother_front}, the r\^ete is not incorporated into the mother here. The hours advance clockwise around the edge of the mother.
\item {\tt rule\_north.???} -- The rule and the alidade of a northern-hemisphere astrolabe.
\item {\tt rete\_north.???} -- The r\^ete of a northern-hemisphere astrolabe.
\item{\tt climate\_xxN.???} -- The climate of the astrolabe, customised to the required latitude {\tt xx}$^\circ$N.
\end{itemize}

For latitudes in the southern hemisphere, the following images should be
printed. Note that a different r\^ete is required, showing the southern sky,
and that the declination scale on the rule also changes sign:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\tt mother\_back.???} -- The back of the mother of the astrolabe. This image also appears in Figure~\ref{mother_back}, and is not latitude dependent.
\item {\tt mother\_front\_south.???} -- The front of the mother of a southern-hemi\-sp\-here astrolabe. Note that, in contrast to Figure~\ref{mother_front}, the r\^ete is not incorporated into the mother here. The hours advance anticlockwise around the edge of the mother.
\item {\tt rule\_south.???} -- The rule and the alidade of a southern-hemisphere astrolabe.
\item {\tt rete\_south.???} -- The r\^ete of a southern-hemisphere astrolabe.
\item{\tt climate\_xxS.???} -- The climate of the astrolabe, customised to the required latitude {\tt xx}$^\circ$S.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Customised Astrolabes}

The astrolabe images presented here were produced using PyXPlot, an open-source
vector graphics scripting language developed by the same author.  PyXPlot has a
website\footnote{\url{http://www.pyxplot.org.uk}} with extensive documentation,
and is available as a standard package in a number of Linux distributions
including Ubuntu, Debian and Gentoo. Unfortunately, it is not available for
Microsoft Windows at the present time.

The PyXPlot scripts used to generate the images in this document are included
in the accompanying file archive and may be modified to generate customised
astrolabes. For example, to produce an astrolabe with your own choice of
saints' days or birthdays on the back of the mother, the file {\tt
Raw\-Data/\-Saints\-Days\-.dat} should be modified. A {\tt Makefile} is
included which rebuilds all of the image files shipped in the {\tt output}
directory.
