The files in this directory are the electronic materials which accompany the
author's paper, "Building a Model Astrolabe" in the Journal of the British
Astronomical Association.  It also contains images of all of the components
which need to be printed out to build model astrolabes tailored for a range of
latitudes. The astrolabe presented here is a slightly modernised version of
that described in Geoffrey Chaucer's c. 1391 Treatise on the Astrolabe, and has
been constructed following a slight modification of the prescription described
in Eisner (1975, 1976a, 1976b).
